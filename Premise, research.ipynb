    "# 1. Momentum strategy\n",
    "Momentum trading is based on the idea that assets which are moving strongly in one direction will continue to do so. Traders enter long positions when prices rise with strong volume and exit when signs of exhaustion or reversal appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **When it works**: In trending markets with strong directional movement and high liquidity.\n",
    "- **When it fails**: In choppy or sideways markets, where breakouts often turn into fakeouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Principles\n",
    " - Momentum strategies often analyze price trends over longer time frames to identify strength but aim to exploit short-term price movements by entering trades during strong trends and exiting before they fade.\n",
    " - Because momentum can reverse quickly-especially if news or sentiment shifts-momentum traders tend to use tight stop-loss orders to protect accumulated gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indicators\n",
    "- **RSI (Relative strength index)** - momentum indicator that measures the speed and change of price movements, typically used to identify overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions in a market.\n",
    "- **MACD (Moving average convergence divergence)** -  trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a price, typically used to identify potential buy/sell signals through crossovers and divergences.\n",
    "- **Moving averages** - Simple Moving Average (SMA) or Exponential Moving Average (EMA) can act as dynamic support or resistance in a trending market.\n",
    "- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**  \n",
    "  Helps measure the strength of a trend. A high ADX value (typically > 25 or 30) indicates a strong trend that momentum traders may capitalize on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Volume Indicators (e.g., OBV – On Balance Volume)**  \n",
    "  Rising OBV alongside price suggests that the trend is supported by strong market participation, making it more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The next important thing is to define strategies for entry and exit, since we depend on strict rules and not gut feelings.\n",
    "## Entry and Exit Strategies for Momentum Trading\n",
    "\n",
    "Momentum traders use specific rules to decide when to enter and exit trades. Common tactics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Breakout Entry**  \n",
    "  Enter when the price breaks a key resistance (uptrend) or support (downtrend) level. Confirmation with higher-than-average volume signals a good entry point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pullback Entry**  \n",
    "  Buy on a pullback to a shorter-term moving average (e.g., 20-day or 50-day MA) within a strong uptrend to improve risk/reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Trailing Stop Loss**  \n",
    "  Use a trailing stop loss placed below higher lows (in an uptrend) to protect profits as the price moves favorably.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Profit Targets and Scaling Out**  \n",
    "  Set profit targets at key resistance levels or use indicators to detect trend weakening, gradually scaling out of the position to secure gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let us run through an example. We will define three more terms:\n",
    " - **Resistance level** - a price ceiling where the asset’s price has repeatedly struggled to go higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support level** - a price floor where the asset’s price has repeatedly struggled to go lower.\n",
    "- **Breakout level** - specific price point where the price of an asset moves beyond a well-established resistance or support level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a tech company’s stock has been trading steadily around \\$150 for several weeks, facing resistance at that price. Suddenly, a major news announcement reveals that the company secured a large government contract, boosting investor confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the news, the stock price quickly rises and breaks above the 150 resistance level, reaching 160. This 150 price point becomes the **breakout level**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **News impact:** The government contract announcement acts as a catalyst, driving buying interest and momentum.\n",
    "- **Breakout confirmation:** The stock price breaks above \\$150 on high trading volume, signaling strong buying pressure.\n",
    "- **Trading strategy:** A trader waits for a slight pullback near \\$153 to confirm the breakout holds, then enters a long position.\n",
    "- **Risk management:** A stop loss is placed just below the breakout level, at \\$148, to protect against a false breakout.\n",
    "- **Exit plan:** The trader trails the stop loss upwards as the price climbs, and exits if the price falls back below key support levels or momentum indicators weaken."

    "# Mean Reversion Trading\n",
    " \n",
    "Mean Reversion Trading assumes asset prices will revert to their long-term average after significant deviations. When prices stray too far from this average, traders expect a reversal toward normal levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overbought / Oversold:** Prices that rise too fast are overbought; sharp falls signal oversold conditions. Traders aim to profit from these extremes.  \n",
    "- **Reversion to the Mean:** The “mean” can be a moving average, equilibrium price, or historical range. Prices tend to revert here over time.  \n",
    "- **Contrarian Approach:** Traders act against strong market sentiment — buying when others sell and selling when others buy too eagerly.  \n",
    "- **Patience:** Markets can stay overextended longer than expected, so waiting for ideal setups is key.  \n",
    "- **Risk Management:** Since trades go against strong trends, tight stop-losses are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Identifying Mean Reversion Trades\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extreme RSI values:** Above 70 (overbought) or below 30 (oversold)  \n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands:** Price closing outside upper/lower bands suggests reversal  \n",
    "- **Price Channels:** Price moving outside channel often reverts inside  \n",
    "- **Moving Average Deviations:** Large gaps from 50 or 200-day MA can signal reversion  \n",
    "- **Volume Spikes:** Sudden volume after big moves may show exhaustion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RSI:** Highlights overbought/oversold levels  \n",
    "- **Stochastic Oscillator:** Shows momentum extremes (above 80, below 20)  \n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands:** Detect price extremes relative to volatility  \n",
    "- **CCI:** Overbought (+100) and oversold (-100) levels  \n",
    "- **MACD Divergences:** Momentum weakening hints at reversals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entry & exit strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Short Entry (Overbought):**  \n",
    "  - RSI > 70, price near/above upper Bollinger Band  \n",
    "  - Confirm with volume decline or bearish candlesticks  \n",
    "  - Enter short when price turns down  \n",
    "- **Long Entry (Oversold):**  \n",
    "  - RSI < 30, price near/below lower Bollinger Band  \n",
    "  - Confirm with bullish candlesticks and volume spike  \n",
    "  - Enter long when price bounces  \n",
    "- **Exit:**  \n",
    "  - Target the mean (e.g., moving average or Bollinger middle band)  \n",
    "  - Oscillators returning to neutral (RSI ~50) can signal exit  \n",
    "- **Stop-Loss:**  \n",
    "  - Set beyond recent price extremes to limit losses\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A stock rallies from \\$80 to \\$120 after good news. RSI reaches 85, price closes above upper Bollinger Band multiple days, volume declines signaling momentum fading.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Entry:** Wait for bearish candle near $122 , short at \\$120 on confirmation.  \n",
    "- **Stop-Loss:** Above swing high at \\$125.  \n",
    "- **Exit:** Target 20-day MA near \\$105 to take profits.\n",
